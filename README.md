# Testing with Postman

You can test the Task Manager application using Postman, a popular tool for testing APIs. Hereâ€™s how you can test the available endpoints:

#### 1. Sending a POST Request

To create a new task, you can send a POST request to `http://localhost:8080/tasks`. The request should include a JSON body as follows:

```json
{
  "pattern": "CFG",
  "input": "ABCDEFG"
}
```
This request will create a new task with the given pattern and input. The response from this request will include an ID for the newly created task.

#### 2. Sending a GET Request

Once you have the ID of a task, you can retrieve its details using a GET request to http://localhost:8080/tasks/{id}, where {id} is the ID of the task.

For example, if the ID of your task is c2377fae-d745-40ff-8393-1171fb7ccbee, you would send a GET request to 
```bash 
http://localhost:8080/tasks/c2377fae-d745-40ff-8393-1171fb7ccbee
```

This request will return the details of the task associated with the given ID.
